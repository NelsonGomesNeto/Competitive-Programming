OH NO, fitting gifts in a grid??
Not only that, but allowing every rotation on a 50x50 grid with 6*60 gifts??????

I was SO scared of this one hahaha.
Luckily, the test cases were easy and you can do cheap verifications like:
`sum total required cells` > area.

I tried that + a bruteforce to double-check just in case. But when it fits, it
fits with a BIG margin.
Since I'm running a bruteforce just in case, it takes 15s.

Nelson from the future here, I was trying to prioritize moves which maximize the
free space so each iteration was using A LOT of memory. I believe that will find
the solution faster on tighther spaces but the test cases have a BIG margin so
we can skip that and bruteforce in 700ms \o/.

The images of the presents in the grid are so pretty (for both versions!).

This year was AWESOME again and I'm looking forward for the next year \o/.
Thank you so much!
