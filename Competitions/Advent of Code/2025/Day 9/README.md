I got scared for a second but the image is so pretty. It's a diamond shaped
heart! hahaha

I compressed the coordinates and bruteforced everything. I literally test all
combinations and for each combination I check if there is an invalid position
inside the rectangle. It runs in ~50ms.

It's pretty fast already but why not use accumulated sums to check in O(1)
instead of O(n*m)? It goes downt o 10ms \o/.
